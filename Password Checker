#Exercise: Password Checker
 
username = input('Hi! What is your username?') #Asks for username, saves to username
password = input('Now enter your password.') #Asks for password, saves to password
password_length = len(password) #saves length of password
hidden_pass = password_length * '*' #converts password to *****
 
print(f'{username}, your password {hidden_pass} is {password_length} letters long')
